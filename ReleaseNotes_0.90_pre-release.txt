 Project X 0.90 pre-release
 10.09.2005

   collects all patches from 0.82.1 and some fixes

   it is possible to compile and run it without the gui (javax.swing.) (means all source files in /gui/..).
   so there is no requirement of running a X server or similars anymore, calling it from the commandline.

   the source/key/settings handling has been changed completely, that means i.e. CL + ini parameters. 
   old one's won't work anymore.
   tell us, whether or not more CLI switches are wished. (with examples)

   the gui and its placement of options has been changed, don't cry..

 why a pre-release?
   there are so many changes inside, that we would be happy when it works as before at this point.
   we can't test all functions, that is your part.. pls check the functions with your files.

   don't expect better error handling. that will come sometime later.. we still have to make a lot of changes.

   the language files have to be updated.

   I haven't the time to write a whole description of all changes for this pre.
   but I'm sure you'll find it out..
