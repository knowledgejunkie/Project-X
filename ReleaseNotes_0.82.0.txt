 Project X 0.82.0  
 xxxxxx


   fix - GUI: nullpointerexception: {patch video basics} w/o a selected file
   fix - all: nullpointerexception: stream processing w/o or disabled content
   fix - demux: video gop-summary: always shown 'interlaced & progressive pictures', independent of content
   fix - demux: mp2 conversions: now better handling of exceptions and type mismatchs
   fix - demux: split output: didn't work for ES-video; to prevent lost of sync, it always start analysis from pos.0
   fix - demux: stream pts offsets didn't affect new stream content (IDs) found after a change of this offset
   fix - demux: dvb subpictures: decoding errors on some streams

   change - preview cutpoints: additional mark by magenta lines on the 'timeline'
   change - scan fileinfo: adaption for MPG=>sPES special stream types content
   change - concatenate diff. files: pts offset value changed
   change - processing: check, whether write access is possible to specified output directory, stops processing if that check fails
   change - post commands: now back to V0.81.8 handling, Java's own parsing of commandline sometimes failed; now set "?x" in quotes to quote all arguments, too
   change - a lot internals

   new - <messages>: option to append the current process time index to any log info 
   new - <messages>: option to disable the 'PES header in ES'-message   (demux only)
   new - <options>: option to close program after the job has been finished
   new - <video>: option to insert an additional sequenzendcode if a change in video format occurs (demux only)
   new - <video>: option to add/patch the sequence.display.extension/SDE, an emtpy field repeats the encoded size (recommended), otherwise key in any other value (e.g. '720*576')  (demux only)
   new - <special>: option to catch a little backward glitch in video pts  (demux only)
   new - <special>: option to handle different cell_times in VOBs (pts's in cells are not continuous) (demux only)
   new - <subtitle>: teletext: option to draw outlined text char's (if less than 4 colors/pic in source) instead of a complete half transparent background for the whole subtitle picture
   new - <GUI menu>: online connection to verify the latest version info and availability (may not work with a proxy)
   new - <CLI>: accepts a batch (txt-)file/URL as input, with the extensions 'bfl' or 'tpl' (then this must include one file segment per line as input). ATM, this batch file doesn't support full unicode for FTP input URLs, so keep them simple.
   new - TS export: additional PMT entry to fit AC3 to some players
   new - scan fileinfo: TS: shows VPS(VBI)-PIDs and PIDs stream identifier of this service, and with better sorting of multiple media PIDs
   new - TS: VPS(VBI)-PIDs will now be ignored (less misinterpretation with other private data streams)
   new - preview: some code outsourced for faster decoding; usage is optional/system dependent (copy the Win32's '.dll' in the "/lib" folder to the .jar's working or system directory)
   new - <coll spec.>: preview: option to udpate picture while scrolling
   new - <options>: preview: buffersize is user defined, lower values read/store less data to find next I-Frame

   new - new input interface:
       - implements a FTP-Client (ATM read access only), provided by Apache's Jakarta Project libraries 'commons-net' and 'oro' 
         (both are required! take care that the compiled versions are suited to your JRE, there's no backward compatibility!)
       * supports any ports, remote rename and resume(aka. 'REST', ftp-server should provide it for preview/cut and hexviewer)
       * supports user specific FTP commands (executed before processing) (<extern> panel, multiple commands delimited by '|')
       * simple FTP access is possible by adding a known URL in the file context menus or as a CLI argument
       * enhanced FTP access with directory listings is possible through the 'autoload panel', by choosing and testing a connection
         (ftp settings will be saved, but chosen directory listings not, because an offline server to connect on startup blocks)
       * dependent on the ftp-server, some features are not available or do not work as designed
         (we encounter problems with 'spaces in directory names', 'inaccessible big files', 'no support of resume', 'slow response time')
       - File- (also as file:URL) and Topfield-HD access should work as before
       - now, slow data input shouldn't result in data-lost (wrong file pointers) anymore
