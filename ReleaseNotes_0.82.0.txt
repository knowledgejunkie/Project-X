 Project X 0.82.0  
 xxxxxx


   fix - nullpointerexception: {patch video basics} w/o a selected file
   fix - nullpointerexception: stream processing w/o or disabled content
   fix - video gop-summary: always shown 'interlaced & progressive pictures', independent from content
   fix - post commands: now back to V0.81.8 handling, Java's own parsing of commandline sometimes failed
   fix - mp2 conversions: now better handling of exceptions and type mismatchs
   fix - split output: didn't work for ES-video; to prevent lost of sync, it always start analysis from pos.0

   change - preview cutpoints: additional mark by magenta lines on the 'timeline'
   change - scan fileinfo: adaption for MPG=>sPES special stream types content
   change - concatenate diff. files: pts offset value changed
   change - processing: check, whether write access is possible to specified output directory, stops processing if that check fails
   change - a lot internals

   new - <messages>: option to append the current process time index to any log info 
   new - <messages>: option to disable the 'PES header in ES'-message   (demux only)
   new - <options>: option to close program after the job has been finished
   new - <video>: option to insert an additional sequenzendcode if a change in video format occurs (demux only)
   new - <video>: option to add/patch the sequencedisplayextension/SDE, an emtpy field repeats the encoded size (recommended), otherwise key in any other value (e.g. '720*576')  (demux only)
   new - <special>: option to catch a little backward glitch in video pts  (demux only)
   new - <special>: option to handle different cell_times in VOBs (pts's in cells are not continuous) (demux only)
   new - <GUI menu>: online connection to verify the latest version info and availability
   new - <CLI>: accepts a batch (txt-)file/URL as input, if it ends w/ 'bfl' or 'tpl' (then this includes one file segment per line of input). ATM, this batch file doesn't support full unicode for FTP input URLs, so keep them simple.
   new - TS export: additional PMT entry to fit AC3 to ATSC 
   new - scan fileinfo: TS: shows VPS(VBI)-PIDs and PIDs stream identifier of this service, with better sorting of multiple PIDs
   new - TS: VPS(VBI)-PIDs will now be ignored (less misinterpretation with other private data streams)
   new - preview: some code outsourced for faster decoding; usage is optional/system dependent, by copying the Win32's '.dll' in the "/lib" folder to the working or system directory

   new - new input interface:
       - now implements a FTP-Client, provided by Apache's Jakarta Project libraries 'commons-net' and 'oro' 
         (both are required! take care that the compiled versions are suited to your JRE, there's no backward compatibility!)
       * supports any ports, remote rename and resume(aka. 'REST', ftp-server should provide it for preview/cut and hexviewer)
       * simple FTP access is possible by adding a known URL in the file context menus or as a CLI argument
       * enhanced FTP access with directory listings is possible through the 'autoload panel', by choosing and testing a connection
         (ftp settings will be saved, but chosen directory listings not, because an offline server to connect on startup blocks)
       * dependent on the ftp-server, some features are not available or do not work as designed
         (we encounter problems with 'spaces in directory names', 'inaccessible big files', 'no support of resume', 'slow response time')
       - File- (also as file:URL) and Topfield-HD access should work as before
       - now, slow data input doesn't result in data-lost (wrong file pointers) anymore
